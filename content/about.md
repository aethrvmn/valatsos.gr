I'm currently pursuing a M.Sc. in Stochastics and Data Science at the University of Torino, where my thesis work explores multi-agent reinforcement learning, which involves developing a training environment with PyGame. 

My academic background also includes a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, with a thesis on simulating the strong disorder renormalization group method for a specific model in quantum mechanics.

I'm a Data Scientist with a strong background in Python programming, focusing on developing efficient data management solutions. At Students for Liberty, I led the development of an alumni database, utilizing SalesForce for data management and alumni relations. I also used ReactJS and PostgreSQL for internal projects and Bitbucket for version control. This experience honed my skills in creating tools that simplify complex data processes.

I'm currently pursuing a M.Sc. in Stochastics and Data Science at the University of Torino, where my thesis work explores multi-agent reinforcement learning. This involves developing a training environment with PyGame2, which I plan to publish. My academic background also includes a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, with a thesis on simulating the strong disorder renormalization group method for a specific model in quantum mechanics.

My approach is practical and focused on applying programming skills to solve real-world problems. I enjoy the challenge of turning complex requirements into functional, user-friendly solutions. I'm always looking to learn and apply new technologies that can improve efficiency and outcomes in my projects.

I'm interested in opportunities that allow me to contribute to meaningful projects, particularly those that can benefit from my blend of programming expertise and a solid foundation in data science and physics.
